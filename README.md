## Certification Sub-Scope

Ethical design is the practice of designing products, services, and systems in a way that takes into consideration the ethical implications of their development, use, and disposal. It involves considering the potential impacts of these products and systems on individuals, groups, and society as a whole, and designing them in a way that is responsible, transparent, and respectful of the rights and interests of all stakeholders.

Ethical design involves thinking critically about the values that are built into a product or system, and ensuring that they are aligned with the principles of fairness, justice, and respect for human rights. It also involves considering the potential unintended consequences of a product or system, and taking steps to minimize any negative impacts or harm that may result from its use.

Ethical design is an important consideration in a wide range of fields, including technology, engineering, design, and business. It is particularly relevant in the context of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, which have the potential to transform society in significant ways and raise complex ethical questions.

Automated decision-making refers to the use of computer algorithms and other automated processes to make decisions or recommendations, without the direct involvement of a human. These decisions can be made based on data that has been collected and analyzed by the system, and may be used to make recommendations or take actions in a variety of contexts.

Automated decision-making systems can help to process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. However, they also raise concerns about bias and accountability, as they may make decisions based on incomplete or biased data, or in ways that are difficult for humans to understand or explain. As a result, it is important to carefully consider the ethical implications of automated decision-making systems, and to ensure that they are designed and used in a way that is fair and transparent.
